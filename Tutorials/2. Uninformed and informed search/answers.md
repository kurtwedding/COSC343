# 1. What's a look ahead problem? Give an example.


# 2. How can a look-ahead search problem be formalised as a state space?

# 3. Consider the search-tree below.
#         n1
#    n2     n3
# n4 n5 n6 n7
# What order would the nodes be encountered if the graph was searched:
##  (a) depth first left-to-right?
n1, n2, n4, n5, n3, n6, n7
##  (b) breadth-first right-to-left?
n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7

# 4. Alternative search strategies
##  (a) Summarise the advantages of depth-first and breadth-first search.

##  (b) How does iterative deepening search obtain the advantages of both methods while avoiding their disadvantages?
